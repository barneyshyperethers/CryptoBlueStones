# Withdrawal Functions Documentation

## Overview

This smart contract system includes comprehensive withdrawal functions for ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 NFTs. All withdrawal functions implement OpenZeppelin security patterns with proper access control and safe transfer mechanisms.

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **onlyOwner**: All withdrawal functions are restricted to contract owners
- **nonReentrant**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation

### Safe Transfer Patterns
- **ETH Transfers**: Using OpenZeppelin's `Address.sendValue()`
- **ERC20 Transfers**: Using OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()`
- **ERC721 Transfers**: Using OpenZeppelin's `IERC721.safeTransferFrom()`

## Withdrawal Functions

### 1. ETH Withdrawal

#### Function Signature
```solidity
function withdrawETH(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner nonReentrant
```

#### Parameters
- `to`: The address to receive the ETH (cannot be zero address)
- `amount`: The amount of ETH to withdraw (0 = withdraw all available)

#### Security Features
- ✅ **Access Control**: `onlyOwner` modifier
- ✅ **Reentrancy Protection**: `nonReentrant` modifier
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Zero address and amount validation
- ✅ **Safe Transfer**: Using `Address.sendValue()`
- ✅ **Event Logging**: `ETHWithdrawn` event

#### Usage Examples
```solidity
// Withdraw all ETH to owner
userFactory.withdrawETH(payable(owner()), 0);

// Withdraw specific amount
userFactory.withdrawETH(payable(recipient), 1000000000000000000); // 1 ETH
```

### 2. ERC20 Token Withdrawal

#### Function Signature
```solidity
function withdrawERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner nonReentrant
```

#### Parameters
- `token`: The ERC20 token contract address
- `to`: The address to receive the tokens (cannot be zero address)
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to withdraw (0 = withdraw all available)

#### Security Features
- ✅ **Access Control**: `onlyOwner` modifier
- ✅ **Reentrancy Protection**: `nonReentrant` modifier
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Contract and address validation
- ✅ **Safe Transfer**: Using `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()`
- ✅ **Event Logging**: `ERC20Withdrawn` event

#### Usage Examples
```solidity
// Withdraw all USDC tokens
userFactory.withdrawERC20(usdcToken, recipient, 0);

// Withdraw specific amount of DAI
userFactory.withdrawERC20(daiToken, recipient, 1000000000000000000000); // 1000 DAI
```

### 3. ERC721 NFT Withdrawal

#### Function Signature
```solidity
function withdrawNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, address to) external onlyOwner nonReentrant
```

#### Parameters
- `nftContract`: The ERC721 NFT contract address
- `tokenId`: The specific token ID to withdraw
- `to`: The address to receive the NFT (cannot be zero address)

#### Security Features
- ✅ **Access Control**: `onlyOwner` modifier
- ✅ **Reentrancy Protection**: `nonReentrant` modifier
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Contract and address validation
- ✅ **Ownership Verification**: Ensures contract owns the NFT
- ✅ **Safe Transfer**: Using `IERC721.safeTransferFrom()`
- ✅ **Event Logging**: `NFTWithdrawn` event

#### Usage Examples
```solidity
// Withdraw specific NFT
userFactory.withdrawNFT(boredApeContract, 1234, recipient);

// Withdraw from different NFT collection
userFactory.withdrawNFT(cryptoPunksContract, 5678, recipient);
```

## Events

### ETH Withdrawal Event
```solidity
event ETHWithdrawn(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
```

### ERC20 Withdrawal Event
```solidity
event ERC20Withdrawn(address indexed token, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
```

### NFT Withdrawal Event
```solidity
event NFTWithdrawn(address indexed nftContract, uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed to);
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Messages
- `"Cannot withdraw to zero address"`: Invalid recipient address
- `"No ETH balance to withdraw"`: No ETH available
- `"Insufficient ETH balance"`: Requested amount exceeds balance
- `"Invalid token address"`: Invalid ERC20 contract address
- `"No token balance to withdraw"`: No tokens available
- `"Contract does not own this NFT"`: NFT ownership verification failed

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- All withdrawal functions are restricted to contract owners
- No public or external access to withdrawal functions
- Ownership can be transferred using OpenZeppelin's `transferOwnership()`

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
- All withdrawal functions use `nonReentrant` modifier
- Prevents recursive calls during execution
- Ensures atomic operation completion

### 3. Input Validation
- Zero address validation for all recipient addresses
- Amount validation (must be > 0)
- Balance validation (cannot exceed available balance)
- Contract ownership verification for NFTs

### 4. Safe Transfer Patterns
- **ETH**: Using `Address.sendValue()` instead of `transfer()`
- **ERC20**: Using `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()` for safe token transfers
- **ERC721**: Using `IERC721.safeTransferFrom()` for safe NFT transfers

### 5. Event Logging
- All withdrawals emit indexed events
- Complete transaction transparency
- Easy monitoring and tracking

## Gas Optimization

### 1. Efficient Storage
- Minimal state variable usage
- Optimized function implementations
- Reduced external calls

### 2. Batch Operations
- Support for withdrawing all available tokens (amount = 0)
- Efficient balance checking
- Optimized transfer operations

### 3. Event Optimization
- Indexed parameters for efficient filtering
- Minimal event data
- Efficient event emission

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test all withdrawal functions with valid parameters
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify access control mechanisms

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test with real ERC20 and ERC721 tokens
- Verify event emissions
- Test reentrancy protection

### 3. Security Tests
- Test access control bypasses
- Test reentrancy attacks
- Test with malicious contracts

### 4. Gas Tests
- Measure gas consumption
- Optimize for efficiency
- Test with different token types

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Emergency Withdrawals
```solidity
// Emergency: Withdraw all ETH
userFactory.withdrawETH(payable(emergencyWallet), 0);

// Emergency: Withdraw all tokens
userFactory.withdrawERC20(tokenAddress, emergencyWallet, 0);
```

### 2. Regular Operations
```solidity
// Regular: Withdraw specific amounts
userFactory.withdrawETH(payable(owner()), 1000000000000000000); // 1 ETH
userFactory.withdrawERC20(usdcToken, owner(), 1000000000); // 1000 USDC
```

### 3. NFT Management
```solidity
// Withdraw specific NFTs
userFactory.withdrawNFT(nftContract, tokenId, newOwner);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Security
- Always verify recipient addresses
- Use multi-signature wallets for large amounts
- Monitor withdrawal events
- Regular security audits

### 2. Operations
- Test withdrawal functions thoroughly
- Monitor contract balances
- Keep withdrawal logs
- Implement proper access controls

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular security updates
